I am an Applied Scientist with Microsoft Turing, based in Toronto. I work on large scale training of language technologies and dialog agents broadly. I am one of the core developers for the Bing Chat released on Feb 6, 2023. Before that I was a graduate student at University of Waterloo co-supervised by Prof. Jimmy Lin and Prof. Pascal Poupart. I worked in the intersection of NLP, graph representation learning and reinforcement learning. At Waterloo, I was awarded the Cheriton Scholarship for my Masters. I received a BTech in Information and Communication Technology with minor in Computational Science from DA-IICT, India. In past, I have done research internships at Mila (Montreal, 2019-20), the Computational Intelligence Lab at Nanyang Technological University (Singapore, 2018), Video Analytics Lab at the Indian Institute of Science (Bengaluru, 2017).
